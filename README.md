# üçû‚òÅ Man√° do C√©u
This project is a simple daily blog website that runs completly at client-side. Each message is stored as a .json in `/public/mana` folder.
There is a index file: `/public/mana/_index.json` that lists each post. When accessing the root page, it will get the day of the year and fetch corresponding post according to index file.
